        <p>
          MagicTrackr was created out of frustration with using Excel to manage a team's
        time.  As the team grew, and the number of projects projects grew it became
        unmanagable to use a spreadsheet to report hours worked. This tracking and
        reporting was  necessicary to ensure the bills were paid and the right people
        were spending their time on the right projects there was just no good way of
        seeing this information from 20,000 ft.
        </p>

        <p>
          MagicTrackr solves these issues by presenting your whole team, all projects,
           and time spent on tasks in one place!
