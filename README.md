MagicTracker🕵🏻‍ is a way for teams to track their time for
budgeting and resource allocation.  Users enter their
tasks in relation to any and all projects they are working
on.  
Projects can have subcategories (called Subtasks) such as
"Meeting", "Communication", "Development", or "Design".
Users can add other users who collaborated on a task.

MVP is now working.

Features in development for v 1.0.0
- Admin Panel
  - Set costs associated with a user's time
  - Moderate and edit existing Projects
  - Analytics on Projects
